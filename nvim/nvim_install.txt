- For nvim plugin manager
Install vim-plug

  Install vim-plug itself:
  curl -fLo ~/.local/share/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim

run nvim and install plugins
:PlugInstall
Waiting for all plugins installation finished.
If failed to install nvim-yarp, we need to configure correct the python3 path in ~/.config/nvim/init.vim and install the following package,
#python3 -m pip install pynvim
Requirement already satisfied: pynvim in /usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages (0.3.2)
Requirement already satisfied: msgpack>=0.5.0 in /usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from pynvim) (0.6.1)
Requirement already satisfied: greenlet in /usr/lib/python3.7/site-packages (from pynvim) (0.4.15)

After above step, re-install plugin nvim-yarp from nvim.

echo "alias vi=nvim" >> ~/.bash_profile
exec $SHELL -l

The config file for nvim is located ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
